DomainMOD also includes a Data Warehouse framework that allows you to import your web server data so that you can view, export, and report on your live data. Currently the Data Warehouse only supports web servers running WHM/cPanel.\n\n\nLive Demo\n\n\nNot sure if DomainMOD is what you're looking for? Don't want to take the time to install it only to find out that it's not? We hate when that happens ourselves, which is why we've setup a live demo so you don't waste your time.\n\n\nSo go ahead, take the live demo for a test drive before you install: \nhttps://demo.domainmod.org\n\n\nDownloading\n\n\nThere are currently three options for downloading DomainMOD.\n\n\nOption #1\n\nVisit the following URL to download DomainMOD in a .ZIP file: \nhttps://domainmod.org/download/\n\n\nOption #2\n\nUse git from your web server to retrieve the DomainMOD source code. To do so, change to the directory where you want to install DomainMOD and run the following command (this download option requires that you have git installed on your web server):\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/domainmod/domainmod.git\n\n\n\nOption #3\n\nUse Softaculous from your web server to download \nand\n install DomainMOD.  Softaculous is the web hosting industry's leading software auto-installer, and it has helped millions of users install applications with a few clicks of a mouse. Softaculous easily integrates into the leading control panels like cPanel, Plesk, DirectAdmin, InterWorx, H-Sphere, and more. Check your hosting control panel or contact your web host if you're not sure if they offer Softaculous.\n\n\nTo install DomainMOD simply open Softaculous, use the search feature to find DomainMOD, and then click the \"Install Now\" button. After you answer a few questions about your installation Softaculous will do the rest.\n\n\nInstalling\n\n\nIf you installed DomainMOD using Softaculous in the previous step you can ignore the rest of this \nInstalling\n section, as you should already have DomainMOD up-and-running.\n\n\nIf you downloaded the .ZIP file in the previous step, you will now need to upload the archive to your web server and then unpack it into the folder where you wish to install (or unpack it and then upload it, whichever you prefer).\n\n\nIf you used git to retrieve the source code in the previous step, just change to the directory where you ran the git command and your files are already waiting for you in a folder called /domainmod/. Feel free to rename this folder to whatever you want.\n\n\nInstallation Steps\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a MySQL database that will be used to store DomainMOD's data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the '_includes' folder, copy config.SAMPLE.inc.php to config.inc.php and then update config.inc.php to reflect your web server's settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a web browser, visit the URL where you just installed DomainMOD, enter the requested information, and then click the Install button. For example, example.com/domainmod/. After a few seconds a message will appear letting you know that the installation was successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup the below cron job on your web server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCron Job\n\n\nDomainMOD includes a Task Scheduler that allows you to run various system jobs at specified times, which helps keep your DomainMOD installation up-to-date and running smoothly, as well as notifies you of important information, such as emailing you to let you know about upcoming Domain \n SSL Certificate expirations.\n\n\nThe Task Scheduler is very powerful, and it enables features that you otherwise wouldn't be able to use, but in order for it to function you need to schedule the below cron job to run on your web server. Once the cron job is setup to run the Task Scheduler will be live.\n\n\nNOTE:\n This file should be executed every 10 minutes.\n\n\nFilename: /cron.php\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nAlthough we've done our best to secure DomainMOD, unfortunately there are many factors that could cause security holes, such as the software being run on insecure hardware, software like PHP and MySQL having out-of-date versions with known vulnerabilities, easy-to-guess passwords being used, and so on. Due to these factors we recommend the following steps to help secure your DomainMOD installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not use easy-to-guess passwords. \nEver\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough DomainMOD has its own authentication system, we recommend that you also use HTTP authentication on your installation folder to add an extra layer of security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not store your account passwords or API keys in DomainMOD. Although the ability to save this information exists, \nuse it at your own risk\n. This information is fairly secure if you run DomainMOD on your local computer, but there's a much higher risk of someone gaining access to it if you host the site on a server that is accessible to the outside world.\n\n\nWARNING:\n Saving your API keys (and other relevant API connection information) in DomainMOD is necessary if you want to use the \nDomain Queue\n, however we recommend that you only save this information temporarily while you're using the Domain Queue, and that you remove it as soon as you're done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not host DomainMOD on a public website or on an easy-to-guess URL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not give the URL to anyone who does not need to access DomainMOD. You should treat the URL like a password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways use the most up-to-date version of DomainMOD. This will help protect you from any security vulnerability that are found and fixed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Run\n\n\nAfter you've installed DomainMOD you should go through the \nFirst Run\n section to finish getting the software ready to use.",

The default username and password are \"admin\", and after you login for the first time you'll be prompted to change your password, which you should do immediately.\n\n\nThe admin account that gets created during installation has full control of your DomainMOD installation, so you should store the password in a safe place.\n\n\nAssets\n\n\nAfter you've logged in you'll need to add a couple pieces of information to the system before you can start adding your domains. We'll refer to these pieces of information as Assets, and they're the building blocks of DomainMOD. Assets include things like the domain registrars that you use, your domain registrar accounts, the categories you want to use for grouping similar domains, and so on.\n\n\nSince every domain must have an owner and belong to a domain registrar and domain registrar account, these are the first Assets that you'll need to add to DomainMOD. The easiest way to proceed with the next steps is to think of one of your domain registrar accounts and use its details as you walk through the below sections. \n\n\nAdd An Owner\n\n\nAlthough recommended, adding an owner at this stage is optional. If you don't add one now you can use the default owner \"[no owner]\" for the remaining steps on this page, and you can then go back later and edit the default owner.\n\n\nThe owner should be whoever owns the registrar account that you're going to add, whether it's an individual's name or a company name. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nAssets\n on the main menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nAccount Owners\n on the Assets list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nAdd Owner\n button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the Owner's Name. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nAdd Owner\n button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd A Domain Registrar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nAssets\n on the main menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nDomain Registrars\n on the Assets list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nAdd Registrar\n button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the Registrar's Name.

If you're receiving messages that the MySQLi extension is unavailable, you will need to install and enable it on your server before you can use DomainMOD.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nCan I import my domains into DomainMOD using a CSV file?\n\n\nNot currently, but this is something that we're investigating for the future. If your domain registrar has an API, and it's \nsupported by DomainMOD\n, you can use the \nDomain Queue\n to automatically import your domains.\n\n\nDoes DomainMOD support multiple languages?\n\n\n\nCurrently only English is supported, but this is something that will be investigated for the future.\n\n\nWhich domain registrar APIs does DomainMOD currently support?\n\n\n\nDomainMOD currently supports DNSimple, Dynadot, eNom, Fabulous, GoDaddy, Internet.bs, Name.com, NameBright, Namecheap, NameSilo, OpenSRS, and ResellerClub.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nAre the domain expiration dates updated automatically using the domain's WHOIS information?\n \n\n\nNo, expiration dates currently need to be updated manually when the domains are renewed. Expiration dates can be updated one-by-one or by using the \nBulk Updater\n.\n\n\nCan I use DomainMOD to sell domains?\n\n\n\nThe primary use for DomainMOD is to manage a large portfolio of domains, and it currently doesn't have any sales features, such as being able to host sales letter landing pages. This is something we're looking at implementing in a future version of DomainMOD.\n\n\nIf all you want to do is track the amount you sold a domain for, you can create a Custom Field, which will allow you to record the sales amount for your domains.\n\n\nHow many domains can I manage with DomainMOD?\n\n\n\nTheoretically there's no limit on the number of domains you can manage, it just depends on your server hardware and the settings chosen in DomainMOD. The default settings can handle thousands of domains, and over 10,000 depending on how much information you've chosen to display on the front page, but if things start slowing down you can enable \"large mode\" to speed things up. Large mode uses a different method for displaying the information on the main domain page, and although it doesn't offer as many of the advances features as the default settings, it allows you to manage a lot more domains.\n\n\nI don't need to keep track of the fees associated with my domains. Can I disable this feature?\n\n\n\nThere's currently no way to disable fees, as the system requires them in order to link the database tables, but if you don't care about keeping track of the fees you can just enter zeros for all of the costs.\n\n\nI noticed you can set the registration, transfer, and renewal prices for domains via their domain registrars, but can you set a purchase price for a specific domain? For example, if I purchase a domain from a 3rd party marketplace can I record this information in DomainMOD?\n\n\n\nAlthough this is not a standard field, you can use \nCustom Fields\n to keep track of the purchase price of your domains.\n\n\nIs it possible to display the custom fields I've created on the main domain page as a column?\n\n\n\nThis is something we're still investigating, as we realize how helpful this feature would be for some people, however if it happens it's probably going to be a while still. Although on the surface it seems like it may be pretty easy to implement, there's actually quite a bit to it and it's going to take quite a bit of work.\n\n\nAlso, since you can accomplish pretty much the same thing by exporting your domain list and sorting the exported data in something like excel (since it includes all of your custom fields), implementing this within the UI is not very high on the priority list.\n\n\nIs it possible to encrypt the data stored in DomainMOD?\n\n\n\nIt's not currently possible to encrypt the data in the database, however it's something we're hoping to implement in some way in the future. Based on our research it wouldn't be a small task to implement, and unfortunately, all things considered, it's just not one of the top priorities at the moment. Adding encryption would also create quite a few challenges with some features we have planned for the future.\n\n\nFor more information regarding the security of DomainMOD, please see \nSecurity\n in the Getting Started section.",

In order for DomainMOD to install and run, strict mode must to be disabled.\n\n\nTo disable strict mode you need to edit your MySQL configuration file. In it there will be a line that looks like:\n\n\nsql-mode=\"STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION\"\n\n\n\nTo disable strict mode you need to remove STRICT_TRANS_TABLES from this line (including the comma after it, if there is one), which in this example would leave you with:\n\n\nsql-mode=\"NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION\"\n\n\n\nOnce disabled you will need to restart MySQL, and then DomainMOD should install properly.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nDomainMOD seems to be working properly, but when I use the software I get a bunch of warning messages, such as \"undefined index\" and \"undefined variable\".\n\n\nThis is related to the error reporting level that you have turned on in PHP. Although these are only warnings and won't actually be breaking anything, you can get rid of them by editing your php.ini file and changing the error_reporting line.\n\n\nRight now you probably have something that looks like this:\n\n\nerror_reporting = E_ALL\n\n\n\nBut you should have something that looks like this:\n\n\nerror_reporting = E_ALL \n ~E_NOTICE \n ~E_STRICT \n ~E_DEPRECATED\n\n\n\nCommented out in your php.ini file, above the error_reporting directive, there may be a suggested error reporting line for a \"Production\" environment. Try using that line instead of what you're using now, restart Apache/PHP, and that should get rid of the errors.\n\n\nI'm trying to connect DomainMOD to my domain registrar account using the API so that I can import my domains, but everything in the Domain Queue just says \"Pending\".\n\n\n\nIn order to import your domains using the domain registrar's API you must setup the \ncron job\n that comes with DomainMOD. In addition to having the cron job running, you must also have your API credential saved along with your registrar account Asset.\n\n\nI've setup the Data Warehouse within DomainMOD, but none of my changes propagate to my web server.\n\n\n\nThe Data Warehouse is read-only. You can import data from your web server into your Data Warehouse, but this data is for informational purposes only, and you can't edit your server data within DomainMOD and have it update your web server. This is something that will be worked on in the future, but is currently not possible.\n\n\nI'm getting the error, \"Database Connection Error: 1045\".\n\n\n\nError 1045 is an access denied error, which seems to be caused when the user doesn't have appropriate permissions on the database, or there's another privilege issue with the database. Unfortunately this is pretty difficult to troubleshoot on our end, as there are many things that can cause this.\n\n\nWe would recommend trying some of the suggestions for this error in Google and see if any of them help: \nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=Database+Connection+Error%3A+1045\n.\n\n\nI'm trying to import data using the Domain Queue, but everything is stuck on \"Processing\".\n\n\n\nIn case there's a problem with the cron job you can also try triggering the queue manually. Go to Administration -\n Task Scheduler, and then beside \"Domain Queue Processing\" click on the \"run now\" link (this may take a bit of time to run). Then go back to the queue and see if anything has changed.\n\n\nIf that doesn't work you can try clearing the queue items that are currently processing by going to Administration -\n Maintenance, and then clicking on \"Clear Queue Processing\". Now try the last suggestion again to see if running the queue manually through the Task Scheduler helps.\n\n\nIf that still doesn't do it go to Administration -\n Maintenance, and then click on \"Clear Queues\". This will completely clear out the queue. Now try retrieving your data again using the Domain Queue.",
