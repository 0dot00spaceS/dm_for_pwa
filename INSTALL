# Installation
1. Please choose from one of the following two options:  

    If you used git to retrieve the source code in the previous step, just change to the directory where you ran the git command and your files are already waiting for you.  

    If you downloaded the source code in the previous step, you will now need to upload the archive to your server and then unpack it into the folder where you wish to install.  

2. Create a MySQL database that will be used to store the Domain Manager information  

3. In the '_includes' folder, copy config.SAMPLE.inc.php to config.inc.php, and then update config.inc.php to reflect your server's settings  

4. In a web browser, visit the URL where you just installed the Domain Manager, followed by /installer/. So if you installed to http://aysmedia.com/dm/, point your web browser to http://aysmedia.com/dm/installer/.  

5. After a few seconds a message should appear letting you know that the installation was successful.

6. If you have any problems during installation, please see the Support section of README.md.
